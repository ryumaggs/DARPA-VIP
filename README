This project is an extension on the GMRA code base implemented by Mauro Maggioni et.al.

GMRA creates multi-scale approximation of high dimensional data. This feature can be exploited to find the low dimension representation of the dataset lie in higher dimension. 

the current setup of GMRA have been tested and can be run directly on Linux system. To run GMRA, first run startup_GMRA.m, then run RunExamples.m to test on multiple dataset.
the shallow training contains 2 test scripts:
   - shallow_ff_network.py : a shallow classifier trained on MNIST dataset represented in low dimension
   - cifar_10_shallow_classifier.ipynb : Applying LeNet architecture to classify CIFAR-10 images when data is represented in low dimension.

these scripts requires '.mat' data to run, this data can be extract by running the GMRA project. However, some preprocessed data is available at:
